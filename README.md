Some notes for the developer

In order to compile the system from eclipse:

- Include the most recent version of the libraries:
 + JUnit
 + SWT
 + log4j 

- Include the 'images' folder in the 'src' folder

- Create a runnable 'muggl.jar' file (the application looks for the existence of such file)

- Check that the 'conf' folder (included in the distribution) in the same folder as muggl.jar
