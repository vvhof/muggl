Some notes for the developer

In order to compile the system from eclipse:

- Include the most recent version of JUnit

- Include the 'images' folder in the 'src' folder

- Create a runnable 'muggl.jar' file (the application looks for the existence of such a file)
 + using the ANT script 

- Check that the 'conf' folder (included in the distribution) in the same folder as muggl.jar

- tested on jdk6, 7 and 8 currently not supported
